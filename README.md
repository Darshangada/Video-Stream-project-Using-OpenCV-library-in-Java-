# Video Stream Project Using OpenCV Library in Java



## Overview

This project aims to analyze and process real-time video streams using Java and the OpenCV library. 

Byimplementing features such as object detection, motion tracking, and facial recognition, we can gain valuable
insights from video data.

Additionally, we’ll create a frontend to visualize the processed video streams and
analysis results.
## Requirements

Java (JDK),

OpenCV library (OpenCV_VERSION 4.10.0)

Webcam or video input source
## Implementation Steps
* ### Setting Up Your Environment:

    Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you haven’t already.

    Download and configure the OpenCV library for Java. Make sure to add the necessary JAR files to your project.


* ### Capture Video Stream:
    Initialize a video capture object to access the webcam or video file.

    Continuously read frames from the video stream.
* ### Processing and Analysis:

    Apply various image processing techniques using OpenCV:

    Object detection (e.g., using Haar cascades or deep learning models)

    Motion tracking (e.g., background subtraction, optical flow)

    Facial recognition (e.g., using pre-trained models).

    Process each frame and extract relevant information.
* ### Visualization Frontend:

    Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the video stream and analysis results.

    Use Java’s Swing or JavaFX for building the frontend.

    Show real-time video frames alongside any detected objects, tracked motion, or recognized faces.
* ### User Interaction:
    Add controls to start/stop video streaming, toggle analysis features, and adjust parameters.

    Provide visual feedback to the user based on the analysis results.
* ### Testing and Optimization:
    Test your system with different video inputs (webcam, recorded videos).
    
    Optimize performance by adjusting parameters and algorithms.
